# Keez rules and gameplay

Keez is a combined board/card game played with two teams of two players each.
The goal is to bring all pawns from both team members to the finish.

## Setting up

-   players on the same team sit across the table from each other.
-   each player has 4 home positions, 1 start position and 4 finish positions
-   each player puts their 4 pawns on the home positions.
-   decide who will be the first dealer (oldest, youngest, most hair, least hair, just make it fun)

## Play

-   each dealer deals 4 times (which will be 1 round), first time 5 cards, after that 4 cards each time with the remaining cards.
    -the player to the left of the dealer starts by selecting one of their cards to play. After a card is played, the next player plays a card.
-   continue until all cards have been played, then dealer deals again.
    -after dealer has dealt 4 times, player to dealer's left becomes the next dealer.
    (That dealer starts with the whole deck of cards ?)
-   game ends when both players on a team have all pawns in the finish position.

## Rules

-   When a player holds a playable card, it MUST be played. If the player does not hold a playable card, all cards in hand are disposed.
-   when a pawn enters the board, it is put in the start position.
-   pawns in the start position are protected and cannot be "passed" or "hit"
-   pawns move around the board clockwise, unless a 4 is played.
-   except for pawns that have not moved from the start position yet, pawns may not move back past the start position.
    -A player may only move their own pawns, unless a Jack is played, or the player has all their pawns in the finish position, in which case the player may move their team member's pawns.
    -Once a pawn has been moved but is returned to the start position, it is no longer protected, so may be passed
    -pawns may not pass each other once they get to the finish positions. They have to line up in the order they entered.
    -Players can "hit" a pawn by ending in the same position as another pawn. The "hit" pawn is returned to the home position. A player cannot hit their own pawn.

## The cards

-   ACE: player can enter a pawn into play by placing it on the start position, or move a pawn already in play one step
-   FOUR: player moves one pawn 4 steps back. Pawns in play may not move back past start, except for pawns on the start position, that have not moved yet.
-   SEVEN: Player may move 1 pawn seven steps, or divide the seven steps between 2 of their pawns. If one pawn ends up in the finish, the remaining steps may be taken with one of the team member's pawns. Seven steps total MUST be taken.
-   JACK: Player swaps positions of 2 pawns on the board. The swapped pawns cannot be the same color and do not have to be any of the player's own pawns.
-   KING: Player brings a pawn into play by moving it from the home to the start position
-   ALL OTHER CARDS: the value of the card represents the steps a pawn can advance, with the queen representing a 12

Note;
It is more fun when players do not discuss their cards with their team member
A pawn moved back 4 steps from the start position ends up right in front of the finish positions

questions

-   "home" and "start" positions, I switched the name around, seemed to make more sense to me
-   can more than 1 pawn be in the start position?
-   game played with 4 players?
-   Do you have to have all your pawns in the finish before you can move a team member's pawn with part of a seven, just one or just not have any other pawns on the board?
-   Did I understand the swapping correctly?
-   After a pawn has been "hit" and is moved back to the home position, is it not considered protected any more when it enters the game again on the start position? If so, is there a way to keep track of that, maybe mark those pawns?
